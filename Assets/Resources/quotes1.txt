Simplicity carried to the extreme becomes elegance|For every problem there is a solution that is simple, neat—and wrong|Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it|It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows|Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance|Any fool can know, The point is to understand|The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance – it is the illusion of knowledge|The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it|What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others|Quality is not an act, it is a habit|Know how to listen and you will profit even from those who talk badly|Talk does not cook rice|He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever|Distant water does not put out a nearby fire|There are no short cuts to any place worth going|It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop|The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, The second best time is now|Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve|Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead|You can never plan the future by the past|Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark|You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water|Be yourself; everyone else is already taken|Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do|Either you run the day, or the day runs you|If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything|In three words I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life: It goes on|Too many ascetics rui the festival| Five fingers of a hand are never similar
